## Data Requirements

In the main folder there should be a data subfolder that looks like this:
- `data/imgs`: Contains a set of .jpg H&E regions of interest
- `data/labels`: Contains a set of .png labelmaps of tumor and satellite

If you don't see these folders, download them from the data repository.
